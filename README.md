News information web-app.

This is a web-app that shows ratios of bad news to good/neutral news in the main regions of the world.

It consists of several parts:

A webpage that renders the data. Written in JS and deployed with vercel.
An api router/service that queries the database. Written in TS and with render.
A postgres database, also deployed with render.
And a web scraper usint python and scrapy. Probably deployed with render as well.
